# Timed Code Quiz
 A timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.

## Description

This is the fourth assignment from the UConn Coding Bootcamp curriculm. This week combines our working knowledge of the first three week's topics (Git, Terminal, HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, GitLab, Responsiveness, and JavaScript) with the fourth week's topic: JavaScript & APIs.

For this assignment we were to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions from scratch.

## Goals

1. App will run in the browser,
2. Will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. 
3. Will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## Instructions

The following instructions were based on a User Story and the following acceptance criteria: 

#### User Story
```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

## Developer

After last week's assignment, we all needed psychic repair. After a much needed day-off, 
I decided to try a different approach to this week's assignment: I would create a flowchart to break down each element of the quiz. The hope is that the flowshart will help me better understand and organize the JavaScript code. In addition to focusing on a flowchart, I also focused on making more universal and specific element ID names in order to make each file's code more readable and understandable. Redundancies is JavaScript and CSS can be the death of you...as can inconsistent variable names...and just not knowing what to google :)
